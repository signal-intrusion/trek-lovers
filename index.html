        <h3>Belly:</h3>Belly:
        <p class="notes-txt">Belly is a lovely wine and charcuterie bar in Cambridge’s Kendall Square neighborhood. You’ll be eating stinky and fresh cheeses, cured meats, sausages, and fried chicken (there will be many options for vegetarians too). You’ll have a choice of wines, beers, and cocktails too.</p>

        <p class="notes-txt">There will be delicious cake. You must eat it.</p>

        <h2 class="notes-heading">The Plan:</h2>
        <p class="notes-txt">We’re keeping this small. There won’t be a big ceremony or awkward dancing. You can stay as long as you like and eat and drink as much as you want. It’s mostly just an excuse to have a party! More details are coming soon.</p>

        <h2 class="notes-heading">Parking &amp; Transportation:</h2>
        <p class="notes-txt">The parking lot at the Kendall Cinema is across the street from Belly. With validation, a parking spot will cost you $5.</p>

        <p class="notes-txt">If you’re taking the train, it’s a ten minute walk from Kendall Station on the Red Line. </p>

        <h2 class="notes-heading">Out of Town Guests:</h2>
        <p class="notes-txt">There are a handful of hotels in Kendall Square. There are also rooms available on Airbnb for as little as $65/night. For the couch surfers out there, we might be able to hook you up with a friend in town.</p>

        <h2 class="notes-heading">Kids:</h2>
        <p class="notes-txt">This celebration will be taking place at a nice wine bar. There won’t be a place for kids to run around and do all that stuff kids do. Please consider getting a babysitter and treating yourself to a night on the town!</p>

        <h2 class="notes-heading">Gifts:</h2>
        <p class="notes-txt">More than any material gift we want to spend our time with you, our friends and family. Just coming to the wedding is enough of a gift. Seriously.</p>

        <p class="notes-txt">If you’re desperate to give us something, we would love something handmade by you. We don’t need any toasters or fine china or naughty lingerie. And if you don’t want to knit us matching mittens or can some pickles, you could just give us the universal gift card: cash money.</p>
